Each student on the team will present briefly, as exploratory plots already reveal rich insights from the data. Each team member will cover the following discussion points:\n",

    "- What is the research question that we are trying to answer with the plots?\n",
    "- What story can the plot tell us, and what insights will remain hidden?\n",
    "- Justify why the plot is appropriate given the research questions, study design (structure in the data), and data types for each of the variables.\n",

This difference in mean  `logCFU` between the two groups indicates much lower effect size (less than the hypothesized difference of 1 on the log 10 scale), however, it may be still considered as practically significant difference. There is an overlap in the spread of the distributions of the `log10CFU` between the two groups, which indicate that we may not have enough statistical power (sample size) to detect the mean `logCFU` difference between the two groups of around 0.5 on the `log10CFU` scale, which may be expected since the sample size was calculated to detect a much larger effect size (of 1 on the logCFU scale).
