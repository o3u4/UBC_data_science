We would need to aggregate `logCFU` overall samples within each stanchion. Since the paired t test will be run for each vehcile and each city, the aggreagted `logCFU` on the stanchion level are now independent, so the biases introdcued due to the independence assumption are no longer an issue for this research question. However, we induce information loss when we aggrgate the `logCFU` on stanchion level, so these tests will operate under reduced statistical power (less likely to produce statsitically significant results)."
