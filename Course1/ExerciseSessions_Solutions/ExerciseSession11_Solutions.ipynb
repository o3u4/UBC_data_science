    "**Answer Q2.** Yes, the DHARMa plot on the right indicates homogeneity of the residual variance between the comparison groups (the two boxplots show the distribution of the lmer model residuals for each of the comparison groups). So we do not expect heteroscedasticity issues in the lmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The lmer model has a very complex error structure. The nested random effects (specified by (1 | City/VehicleNumber/Pairing/StanchionID), indicate that the variance in the residuals could be due to any of these levels specified in the random effects (City/VehicleNumber/Pairing/StanchionID). The left-over variability then is captured by the residuals. Since the lmer model relies on heavy assumptions about the distributions of the variables in the lmer, the DHARMa package uses a simulation approach to simulate the residuals. The plots indicate that after accounting for the variability (correlation in the observations within various levels City, VehicleNumber, Pairing, StanchionID, the residuals are complying to the assumptions of the lmer. In addition, DHARMa runs tests for the assumptision (e.g., Kolmogorov Simrnoff for normality of the residuals, Levene test for equality of the residual variance between the two groups, H0: Var_Copper^2 = Var_Control^2, HA: Var_Copper^2 <> Var_Control^2, which would show red color on the DHARMa plots in case of severe violation of the assumptions. These significant p-values could be only artefacts of large sample sizes -- remember, the drawback of the p-values is that given a large sample size, p-values can detect event the smallest deviations from the assumed values, so these need to be assessed throughly.

So, we have a covariance structure of the residuals within Stanchion ID between samples. The other covariance matrices are for the random effects: between StanchionID within Pairing, between Pairing within VehicleNumbers, and between VehicleNumbers within Cities. The `lme4` R package models only the variances of each random intercept (and random slope) model, assuming covariances between the random effects are 0. Additionally, all the variance estimates of the random effects are obtained under the assumption that the variability of the `logCFU` is approximately the same within each level of these variables (i.e., same variability within Stanchions, Pairings, VehicleNumbers, and Cities). The random effects estimates can be interpreted as between level variability (between Stanchions within VehicleNumber, between Pairing within VehicleNumber, between VehicleNumber within City), while assuming that (within Stanchions variability is the same, Within Pairs variabilities are the same, within Vehcile variability is the same, and within City variability is the same). The lme4 assumption about the variance-covariance structure assumes that the between level variances are different, while the covariances are zero. This is different from the repeated measures ANOVA assumption of compound symetry which expect same between level variances and covariances (same variance between Stanchions, between Pairs, between Vehicles and between Cities, as well as same covariances between Stanchions, Pairs, vehcile numbers and Cities). \n",

    "Spaghetti plot indicates that there might be few slopes that are not parallel, suggesting that some slopes for the Group may be different at different levels in the data structure (City, VehcileNumber, Paring, StanchionID). We can explore fitting spearate slopes for Group for each of the levels (City, VehcileNumber, Paring, StanchionID), by fitting a more complex model that will incorporate random slopes for Group for each nesting level City,VehicleNumber,Pairing,StanchionID, in addition to the random intercepts for each of the levels (the random intercepts model estimates one common slope of the Group across all the levels of nesting City,VehicleNumber,Pairing,StanchionID).\n",

The two models then can be compared by looking into AIC and BIC each of which penalize for the complexity of the model in a slightly different way (the random slope model is way to complex, notice that number of parameters is 15, compared to the random intercepts model that has only 7 parameters in the model). Based on the smallest AIC and BIC, the model with random slopes and intercepts cannot be justified, so we can choose the simpler model, the random intercept only model (1  | City/VehicleNumber/Pairing/StanchionID), which would estimate one common slope for the Group overall the specified complexities by City, VehcileNumber, Pairing and Stanchion. This overal slope of the Group accross all the nesting levels City,VehicleNumber,Pairing,StanchionI is shown in dark navy blue color in the Spaghetti plot above."
