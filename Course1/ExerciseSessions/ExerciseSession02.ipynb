    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this study is to test the effect of three Copper products after 12 months of use on public transit. Copper is known for its biocidal properties against microorganisms. During the COVID pandemic, epidemiological measures were taken to reduce the spread of transmissible diseases. A mining company that produces Copper funded this research study to assess the usability of Copper on public transit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of copper (Cu) alloys to high-touch surfaces could help reduce the risk of cross-contamination; however, little is known about the durability and efficacy of engineered copper surfaces after prolonged use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three different commercially available Cu alloy products, ranging from 80 to 91.3% Cu content, were installed on high-touch surfaces in buses and trains (SkyTrain) in Vancouver, as well as subway cars, streetcars, and buses in Toronto, and monitored over the course of one year. The primary objective of this study was to establish the antimicrobial efficacy and durability of Cu alloy surfaces over 12 months of use in public transit vehicles located in two Canadian cities.\n",

    "### **Primary Research Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the use of Copper products reduce the biomass on public transit in Vancouver and Toronto after 12 months?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Study Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanchions (handrails on public transit) are highly touchable surfaces frequently used by passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, copper products were randomly installed on 110 stanchions across three buses and four trains (SkyTrain) in Vancouver, and three buses, two subway cars, and two streetcars in Toronto. Each copper-coated stanchion was paired with a control stanchion placed nearby to ensure close proximity for comparison. Bacterial counts (Colony Forming Units, CFU) were measured every two months after peak morning routes. A Petrifilm Plate Reader Advanced imager was used to collect and process the microbial samples in the microbiology lab to obtain CFU numbers. Three replicate samples were taken from each stanchion for both copper-coated and control surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is extensive literature supporting CFU as a reliable measure of biomass on highly touchable surfaces in public transit, so this will be used as the primary outcome measure for this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 12-month trial was conducted in collaboration with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and Vancouver TransLink (TL). A total of 14 vehicles were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microbial samples were collected one to three hours after the last passenger departed from the transit vehicle and prior to cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although cleaning protocols were changing over the study period, microbial samples for copper and control stanchions were taken simultaneously, as the main objective was to compare the copper-coated surfaces to the control surfaces after 12 months.\n",
