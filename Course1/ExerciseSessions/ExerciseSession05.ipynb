    "Today's exercises will focus on answering a predefined research question. At the end of the exercise session, each team will present their results. Each student on the team will present briefly, as exploratory plots already reveal rich insights from the data. Each team member will cover the following discussion points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the research question that we are trying to answer with the plots?\n",
    "- What story can the plot tell us, and what insights will remain hidden?\n",
    "- Justify why the plot is appropriate given the research questions, study design (structure in the data), and data types for each of the variables.\n",
