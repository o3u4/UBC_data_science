    "The AirCare program, established in September 1992, aimed to reduce harmful emissions in the Lower Fraser Valley by systematically testing light-duty vehicles. This study used the dataset of the AirCare program in 2000 to explore the impact of front wheel drive (FWD) on ASM carbon monoxide emissions (CO2). There were 7 different versions of FWD (\" High-Performance\", \"Luxury\", \"Normal\", \"Sport\", \"Touring\", \"Urban/Utility\", \"Hybrid\"), and \"H\", \"L\", \"T\", \"U\", \"Y\" had lower ASM carbon monoxide emissions than \"N\" and \"S\", there was no apparent difference between \"N\" and \"S\"(only about0.034405). This anaysis can be reproduced by R software, tidyverse package, and data from AirCare program. Due to the limitation of sample sizes, the result was not very powerful, but still can be applied to environmental pollution examination or the evaluation of car efficiency."
